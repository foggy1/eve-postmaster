# eve-postmaster

##Messin' with API's

Eve Postmaster is a simple little remoteUI site that auths a user with their Eve Online login and allows them to populate the mail client in game with whatever they type.  The goal is to eventually get a web client that is at least up to snuff with the in-game evemail editor.

Things are still very much in the cleanup phase, but the basic functionality is there.  Thanks to all folks in the Eve dev community who have contributed to the third-party docs and a thriving forum presence.
