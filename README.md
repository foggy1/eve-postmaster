# eve-postmaster

##Extending Evemail

**Eve Postmaster** is a simple little remoteUI site that auths a user with their Eve Online login and allows them to populate the mail client in game with whatever they type.  The goal is to eventually get a web client that is at least up to snuff with the in-game Evemail editor.

**Eve Postmaster** is currently built with a Rails back-end and a React front-end.  For each feature that gets added (most recently the contact list) React's philosophy of managing state really shines.  Rails, however, is technically overkill; but, we'll see where time takes the project.

## Desired Features
* ~~Contact list~~
* ~~Filter contact list (by standing or corp)~~
* Corp and Alliance mail shortcut
* Mailing list

## Stretch
* More robust text editor
* View incoming mails
